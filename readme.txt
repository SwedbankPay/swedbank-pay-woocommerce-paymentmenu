== Installation ==
After you have completed the installation of our plugin, it is now time to start configuring and connecting the plugin towards our services.

If you have an active agreement with us already, you can then use the hyperlinks underneath the fields "Payee ID" and "Access Token" to retrieve and generate these values. Payee ID is used to designate and identify the account that the plugin should report the transaction to and the access token will validate that you have the authority to make transactions for that account. You are only required to do this once during the setup.

If you are in the process of becoming a customer or simply curious about how our services work, feel free to use the generic details below so that you can generate our selection and make transactions.
